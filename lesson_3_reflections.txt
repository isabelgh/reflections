When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
	First of all, keeping work locally is a risk of loosing it, so a remote 
	repository is always a good idea to have as backup. Also, when you 
	collaborate with others it is a lot easier to have a single place remote 
	to store things rather than sending files back and forth.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I want to be in control of what base I have for the stuff I am working 
	on. The local changes might not be done and perhaps in conflict with the 
	remote repository. It might also take some time to sync the files, so if
	it would happen automatically for all changes made it would be difficult 
	to work at the same time. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
	- Fork: A fork is a copy of a github repository. The copy also resides in 
	github. You use a fork when you want to make changes to the files in the 
	repository but you want to keep the original intact. The benefits is that 
	the original writer also gets cred for the files you have copied. 
	- Clone: When you copy a git hub repository to your local computer, that 
	copy is a clone. Use a clone when you can/want to edit the files in the 
	repository and perhaps share it with specific persons to work togehter.The
	original does not stay the same as with a fork. 
	- Branch: A branch is used when you want to work on something that you want 
	to keep local. Like for instance, you have cloned master and you want to 
	run something a bit more experimental on the side that you don't 
	necessarily want to share with others (just yet anyways). In this case it 
	is easy to make a branch until you feel like sharing the new feature.
