When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	First of all, keeping work locally is a risk of loosing it, so a remote repository is always a good idea to have as backup. 	Also, when you collaborate with others it is a lot easier to have a single place remote to store things rather than sending files back and forth.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I want to be in control of what base I have for the stuff I am working on if I am collaborating with others that also make changes to the same repository. It might also take some time to sync the files, so if it would happen automatically for all changes made it would be difficult to work at the same time. There might also be merge conflicts.
