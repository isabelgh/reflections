When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	First of all, keeping work locally is a risk of loosing it, so a remote repository is always a good idea to have as backup. 	Also, when you collaborate with others it is a lot easier to have a single place remote to store things rather than sending 	files back and forth.
